- 👋 Hi, we are @AYeproducer, the Film Production company that helps independent and first-time filmmakers fund their projects.
- 👀 We are interested in artists with good ideas to be shown to the world.
- 🌱 We are currently learning about the coding languages that implement our ideas into the world such as Python and Node.js, and frameworks like React and Firebase 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that build and maintain our ideas of how we can help artists comprehend, find, and initiate with the best resources available  in their communities to bring their films to life
- 📫 You can reach us at our individualized emails at AYeproducer.com (vwalker@ayeproducer.com)
- 😄 The pronouns for both the co-founders are he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: We created this space for artists because we understand the pain points of bringing a film to life and want to bridge those gaps that newer artists experience.
